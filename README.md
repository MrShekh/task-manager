# 📝 Task Manager Backend

A real-time task manager backend built with **Node.js**, **Express.js**, **MongoDB**, and **Socket.IO**. This application allows managers and employees to interact through task assignments, updates, and real-time notifications.

---

## 📌 1. Project Overview

This backend system provides:

- User authentication (Login/Register).
- Role-based access: `Manager` and `Employee`.
- RESTful APIs to create, update, and fetch tasks.
- Real-time communication using **Socket.IO**.
- MongoDB for data storage.

### Assumptions

- Two user roles: `Manager` (can assign/update tasks) and `Employee` (can view/update their own tasks).
- Socket connection is established after successful login.
- JWT tokens are passed via headers for protected routes and Socket.IO handshake.
